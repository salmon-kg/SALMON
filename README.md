# SALMON â€” Syntactically Analysed and Language Model Optimised Natural Language

With the evolution of generative AI, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify the triples from natural language text.  

From prompt engineering to fine-tuning, we have performed various experiments to find the best-fit prompt and parameters for the triple extraction task.  

We have also integrated the [`SynSim`](https://github.com/salmon-kg/SynSim) approach to investigate its effectiveness in LLMs as well.  
We have used our annotated dataset ([`TinyButMighty`](https://github.com/salmon-kg/TinyButMighty)) to evaluate the performance of the applied LLMs.
