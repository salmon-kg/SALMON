Syntactically Analysed and Language Model Optimised Natural Language

With the Evolution of Generative AI, we leverage LLMs to Identify the Triples from Natural Language Text. From Prompt Engineering to Fine-tuning, we performed various experiments To find the best-fit prompt and parameters for the Triple Extraction Task. We have also integrated the SynSim Approach to Investigate its effectiveness in LLMs as well. We used our Annotated Dataset (TinyButMighty: Project-1) to evaluate the performance of applied LLMs.
